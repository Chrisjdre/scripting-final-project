# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-280 Client Side Scripting course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction
The introduction unit was divided into 2 parts.

### part 1
In part 1 we learned about our instructor Marc Hauschildt, we went over a few examples of javascript and we took a look at the course syllabus. I didnt know anything about marc so that was nice to learn about him! 
### part 2
In part 2 we went over setting up a github repo, we got git setup with it aswell so we could sync out work we did in "VS" to out Github Repos, and we went over, Markdown language. I had no idea that Github and Visual Studio could do this and I found it to be quite cool! I had never used markdown but it seemed to be a stright forward markup language. Im am looking foward to more in this class!
