# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-280 Client Side Scripting course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction
The introduction unit was divided into 2 parts.
 
### Part 1
In part 1 we learned about our instructor Marc Hauschildt, we went over a few examples of javascript and we took a look at the course syllabus. I didn't know anything about Marc so that was nice to learn about him!
### Part 2
In part 2 we went over setting up a github repo, we got git setup with it as well so we could sync out work we did in "VS" to our Github Repos, and we went over Markdown language. I had no idea that Github and Visual Studio could do this and I found it to be quite cool! I had never used markdown but it seemed to be a straightforward markup language. I am looking forward to more in this class!

## Chapter 1

### part 1

In part 1 we were introduced to JavaScript and how it relates to python. We went over the fact the javascript is dynamically typed, it's interpreted not compiled, it is a very popular language, and it makes the user experience way better. In part 1 we also saw our first javascript program,

### part 2

In Part 2 we went over writing text to the screen in javascript using `document.write`, and then we learned how to attach an external javascript file like the jquery library, lastly we learned how to track down errors in our code using the developer tools in the web browser.
 
## Chapter 2

### part 1
In part 1 we went over alert statements and print statements using javascript, We then went over variables how to declare variables and what we can do with variables ex. `var age = 19;` and then adding ex. `age++` and lastly we went over combining strings ex.`console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);");` and combing string and numbers ex `console.log("You have " + score + " points");`.
### part 2
Part 2 was quick but had a lot of information, first, we started with arrays and how to declare them, modify them by adding, cutting, pushing, and popping. ex `var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];` There is quite a bit you can do with arrays. The other thing we went over was objects, we just scratched the surface but there was a lot of content.
