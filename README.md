# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-280 Client Side Scripting course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction
The introduction unit was divided into 2 parts.
 
### Part 1
In part 1 we learned about our instructor Marc Hauschildt, we went over a few examples of javascript and we took a look at the course syllabus. I didn't know anything about Marc so that was nice to learn about him!
### Part 2
In part 2 we went over setting up a github repo, we got git setup with it as well so we could sync out work we did in "VS" to our Github Repos, and we went over Markdown language. I had no idea that Github and Visual Studio could do this and I found it to be quite cool! I had never used markdown but it seemed to be a straightforward markup language. I am looking forward to more in this class!
